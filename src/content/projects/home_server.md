## Chapter 1: The Beginning – Why This Project?

Returning from my exchange at Georgia Tech, I was inspired by the brilliant minds I met there. They were either smart or hardworking, or both, and I understood what it truly meant by 'putting in the work'.

In life, you can't just get what you want by waiting for it &ndash; you got to WORK for it.

<center class="italic underline"> You got to put in the extra effort to get that bread. </center>

I didn't have any personal projects back then, so it was time to get started.

---

- **The Idea**: To manage a Linux server environment, including database administration for PostgreSQL.
- **Why It Matters**: Managing a home server was a practical way to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world setting.

## Chapter 2: The Research – Diving Into the Unknown

It was about time I got my hands dirty with some real server management. I figured there were plenty of resources available online, and I was right. In fact, plenty were available on just [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials) alone.

- **Learning the Basics**: By my 5th semester of undergraduate studies, I had already taken some databases classes, learning what is SQL, what are ACID principles, what are normalization techniques blah blah.
- **The Struggles**: Turns out knowing it as head knowledge vs applying it is completely different. Who would've known! /s

## Chapter 3: The Building – The Art of Creation

To apply what I learnt during my classes, I decided to implement a local PostgreSQL database for API data scraping projects via cron jobs.

- **Tech Stack Choices**: Linux, PostgreSQL, cron, RAID
- **Milestones**: Configuring the server; Setting up cron jobs for data scraping; Implementing RAID mirroring for data backup.
- **Unexpected Challenges**: No journey is without obstacles. What went wrong, and how did I adjust my approach?
- **My Personal Struggles**: Talk about the difficult moments when I doubted myself, and what kept me going.

## Chapter 4: The Struggles – The Darkest Hour

Every story has a dark chapter, and this is where things didn’t go as planned. In this chapter, I’ll be honest about the challenges I faced—technical, personal, and even mental.

- **The Hardest Moments**: A detailed look at the difficulties I encountered. What broke, what failed, and how I had to pivot.
- **Self-Doubt**: The moments when I wasn’t sure I would finish. Was the project really worth it? Should I keep going or walk away?
- **The Lesson**: How did I turn these challenges into learning opportunities? How did I find the strength to keep going?

---

## Chapter 5: The Breakthrough – The Turning Point

Every story has a turning point, a moment where everything changes. This is the chapter where the pieces finally clicked into place.

- **The Victory Moment**: What was the breakthrough that made me realize the project was going to work?
- **Celebrating Small Wins**: Even when I hadn’t reached the end goal, the smaller wins along the way were enough to keep me motivated.
- **Adjusting the Vision**: As the project grew, I had to adapt. This chapter is about those pivots.

---

## Chapter 6: The Resolution – The Final Outcome

This is the chapter where the project comes to life. All the pieces I’ve worked on come together to form something functional.

- **The Finished Product**: What does the final product look like? How does it solve the initial problem I set out to address?
- **The Reflection**: How has this project shaped me? What have I learned about myself and my work?
- **Key Takeaways**: If I could go back, what would I do differently? And, importantly, what did I learn that will help me in future projects?

---

## Chapter 7: The Epilogue – Looking Ahead

No story ends without a look to the future. This chapter will explore what’s next for the project and how I intend to improve it going forward.

- **Future Plans**: What features or changes do I plan to implement next? What’s the roadmap for future development?
- **Lessons Learned**: What valuable lessons did I take away from this project? How will these lessons shape the way I approach future work?
- **Gratitude**: A final thank you to the people, resources, and experiences that helped make this project possible.

## Bonus Chapter : Behind-the-Scenes – Unseen Moments

Sometimes, it's not the destination but the journey itself that tells the best story. Here, I’ll share some behind-the-scenes moments, including the funny or unexpected bits that didn’t make it into the main narrative.

- **Unexpected Moments**: Funny bugs, interesting distractions, or moments of personal growth during the project.
- **The "Aha!" Moments**: Those times when everything suddenly made sense or a new realization changed my approach entirely.
