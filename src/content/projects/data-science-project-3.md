## Introduction
This project focuses on using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on text data. Sentiment analysis is a common task in NLP that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text.

## Objectives
- To preprocess and clean text data for analysis.
- To build and evaluate models for sentiment classification.
- To visualize the results of the sentiment analysis.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered text data from various sources such as social media, reviews, and articles.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the text data using techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converted text data into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
4. **Model Building**: Built sentiment classification models using machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Visualization**: Visualized the sentiment analysis results using graphs and charts.

## Results
The sentiment analysis models achieved high accuracy and were able to effectively classify the sentiment of the text data. The visualizations provided insights into the distribution of sentiments across different sources.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated the effectiveness of NLP techniques for sentiment analysis. The models built were able to accurately classify sentiments, and the visualizations helped in understanding the sentiment trends in the text data.
